# Climate Analysis and Flask API Design for Honolulu, Hawaii

Planning a holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii? This project aims to help you analyze the climate data for the area and design a Flask API to access the analysis results. By performing a basic climate analysis and exploring the data, you can make informed decisions for your trip planning.

## Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Utilize Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration.

Connect to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy create_engine() function.

Reflect the database tables into classes using SQLAlchemy automap_base() function, and save references to the classes named station and measurement.

Create a SQLAlchemy session to link Python to the database.

Perform a precipitation analysis to find the most recent date, retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data, plot the results, and print summary statistics.

Conduct a station analysis to calculate the total number of stations, find the most-active station, and query the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data for the most-active station.

## Design Your Climate App

Design a Flask API based on the queries developed in the previous analysis.

Create routes for the following endpoints:

/: Homepage listing all available routes.

/api/v1.0/precipitation: Convert the query results from the precipitation analysis to a dictionary and return the JSON representation.

/api/v1.0/stations: Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

/api/v1.0/tobs: Query the dates and temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data and return a JSON list of temperature observations.

/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>: Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, and designs a Flask API to access the analysis results conveniently. By exploring the climate data and designing the API routes, users can retrieve valuable information for trip planning and make the most out of their vacation in Honolulu. The Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) and Flask application can be referenced for further details and implementation.
